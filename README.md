# Carbon-Emissions-Prediction-using-Atmospheric-Data

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting atmospheric CO₂ emissions using satellite-derived atmospheric composition data. The dataset contains various high-dimensional atmospheric measurements collected globally, including:

* Sulphur Dioxide (SO₂)
* Carbon Monoxide (CO)
* Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂)
* Formaldehyde (HCHO)
* Ozone (O₃)
* UV Aerosol Index
* Cloud properties

Our goal is to build a machine learning model to accurately estimate emissions based on these atmospheric indicators.

## Dataset Information

### Training Data

* **Samples**: 74,005
* **Features**: 76 (including target)
* **Target Variable**: `emission` (CO₂ emission; log-transformed during modeling)

### Test Data

* **Samples**: 28,085
* **Features**: 75 (without target)

---

## Key Features

1. **Geospatial and Temporal Context**:

   * Latitude & longitude
   * Year & week number to capture seasonal and regional variations

2. **Atmospheric Composition**:

   * Column number densities for major pollutants (SO₂, CO, NO₂, HCHO, O₃)
   * Sensor and solar azimuth/zenith angles
   * Cloud fractions, cloud top and base properties
   * Aerosol indices

3. **Derived Features**:

   * Log-transformed emission target to normalize skewness
   * Standardized numerical features to improve model convergence

---

## Data Preprocessing

### Missing Value Handling

* Dropped columns with >90% missing values (e.g., UV Aerosol Layer Height features)
* Imputed remaining missing values with column means (after analysis)
* Ensured no missing values before modeling

### Feature Engineering

* Applied log transformation to `emission` to reduce skewness and improve prediction stability
* Standardized features using `StandardScaler` for consistent scaling across features

### Visualizations

* Heatmaps of missing data patterns
* Distribution plots of the target variable (before and after transformation)
* Feature correlation heatmap for selection

## Modeling Approach

### Feature Selection

Features were selected based on:

* High correlation with `log_emission`
* Atmospheric science relevance (e.g., NO₂ and CO as combustion markers)
* Data completeness and variance

Top features include:

* Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂) columns and slant columns
* Carbon Monoxide (CO) densities and sensor angles
* Sulphur Dioxide (SO₂) columns
* Cloud-related features
* Geospatial data (longitude, latitude)

### Model Training

We experimented with multiple models:

* Linear Regression
* Random Forest Regressor
* XGBoost Regressor

#### Model Performance (Validation Set)

| Model             | RMSE   | MAE    | R² Score |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------ | -------- |
| Linear Regression | 1.9957 | 1.5791 | 0.3489   |
| Random Forest     | 0.2294 | 0.0957 | 0.9914 ✅ |
| XGBoost           | 0.5411 | 0.3952 | 0.9521   |

The **Random Forest Regressor** was chosen for final predictions due to its superior performance and robustness.

## Final Predictions

* Predictions generated on the test dataset using the best-performing model (Random Forest).
* Submission file includes `ID_LAT_LON_YEAR_WEEK` and predicted `emission`.
